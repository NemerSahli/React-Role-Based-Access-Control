# React-Role-Based-Access-Control

I added an `Authorization` for access control a different dashboards. So you just pass the component, and the allowed role to the Authorization HOC.I assume the user has a property `userType`.

- Super admin is able to access the all dashboards.
- Admin is able to access Admin, Organizer and User dashboards.
- Organizer is able to access Organzer and User dashboards.
- User is able to access only User dashboard.
